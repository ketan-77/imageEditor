# üé® ImageEditor

**ImageEditor** is a modular Win32-based image editing application built in C++. It demonstrates a component-based architecture using COM (Component Object Model) aggregation to encapsulate core image processing features and user interaction logging.

The project is split into three parts:

---

## üß© Components Overview

1. **Outer Component (Core Features)**
   - Contains the primary logic for image filtering and processing.
   - Exposes core COM interfaces to clients and aggregates the inner component.

2. **Inner Component (Logging & Extension)**
   - Responsible for user activity logging and analytics.
   - Aggregated by the outer component.
   - Built as a DLL and registered via a `.reg` file.

3. **Client Application (UI and Interaction)**
   - Provides a graphical interface for the user to interact with the image editor.
   - Relies on both inner and outer components via COM.

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Build the Outer Component

```sh
cd imageProcessing_outerComponent
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
copy ..\build\Release\imageProcessingOuterComponent.dll C:\Windows\System32\
regedit /s imageProcessingOuterComponent.reg

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Build the Inner Component

cd imageProcessing_innerComponent
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
copy ..\build\Release\imageProcessingInnerComponent.dll C:\Windows\System32\

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Build the Client Application
cd ../../imageProcessing_client
mkdir build && cd build
